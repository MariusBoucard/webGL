To use the skybox just put these file in cstrike\gfx\env

If you want to replace standard skybox
then rename each of 6 files in this archive.

For example, we need to replace "tsccity_" standard skybox,
then we leave last 2 symbols in the end
and rename the prefix.
bnbfl_bk -> tsccity_bk
bnbfl_up -> tsccity_up
etc.

Don't foget to make backup of original files
in order not to lose any of files.

Thanks!

P.S. Skybox was generated with Terragen.
